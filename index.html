    <div class="scroller"><div class="marquee-outer"><div class="marquee-inner"> . . . Remember! Trash pickup is on Tuesday for Zone A on the north side of Nowheresville, and Thursday for Zone
        B on the south side. Stop living like an animal in filth, and be sure to put out your trash. If not, code enforcement will have to treat you like an animal and come rub your nose in it.
        If the last thing you want to see in life is a city code officer's boot smashing your face into that old Easy-Meal container that's been blowing around your yard for three weeks, just go
        ahead and try us. And you know what? Your neighbors will probably be delighted. Get your life together, and don't screw with the Code Enforcement division. . . .
        Got anyone you want us to take care of? Call (162)555-2911 extension 28. We welcome your call and we're just raring to mess someone up.</div></div></div>
